n = 0
lineA = char[]
lineB = char[]
resultQueue = int[]

-- reader thread --
1. Open data file for reading
2. Read 2 lines and copy to lineA and lineB
3. Pipe lineA and lineB to worker thread for processing, increment n
4. Read next line and copy to lineA/lineB (alternating)
5. Goto step 3

-- worker threads --
1. Sum up bytes in lineA and lineB
2. Subtract lineB from lineA
3. Add result to queue in position n

-- writer thread --
1. Pull result from lowest position in result queue
2. Append result to output file
