1. Open text file [ fopen() ]
2. Read bytes from text file and sum them until we read a newline char [ fread() ]
3. Repeat step 2 for the next line.
4. Subtract the result from 2 from the result from 3 and return.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for each pair of lines in the file and output collected results.
